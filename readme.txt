This port of the original ifc code to the gnu g77 fortran compiler was
implemented by Tom Morse and Michael Hines in collaboration with Roger
Traub.  To run these files first build the executable by typing 
make
in the port2g77 directory.  Finally, type 
./job1 &

to start the job on the machines in the cluster indicated in the
colossusnodes file.  (assuming you have an implementation of mpi).
